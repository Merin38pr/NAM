Children who are bedridden or living in hospitals often face emotional and psychological challenges due to prolonged stays and limited social interaction. To bring joy and comfort to these children, we aim to build a chatbot-storyteller that:
Engages Children: Provides interactive storytelling with animated characters and captivating visuals.
Offers Choice: Allows children to choose stories from various genres (e.g., adventure, fantasy, comedy) and select their favorite characters for interaction.
Supports Narration: Stories can be narrated by real people or auto-narrated during upload.
Catches Attention: Features a colorful, kid-friendly UI designed to attract and entertain children.
This chatbot will serve as a companion to brighten their day, spark imagination, and provide a sense of normalcy during their hospital stay
